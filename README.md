- Saves the data from your matches: Quick Match, Unranked Draft, Storm League, Hero League, Team League, Brawls (those that have replays), and Custom Games
- View information such as Talent choices, Score Summary, Hero Bans, Observers, Team Chat
- Also view personal statistics about your heroes: wins, losses, winrates, talent winrates and much more for different maps and gamemodes
- Includes a built-in [Heroes Profile](https://www.heroesprofile.com/) uploader
